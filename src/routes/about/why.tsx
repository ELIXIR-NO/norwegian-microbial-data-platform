        Microbial and pathogen data are essential for understanding disease
        transmission, antimicrobial resistance, and emerging health threats. Yet
        today, such data are often{' '}
        <strong>scattered across institutions</strong>, stored in incompatible
        formats, or <strong>locked away</strong> due to privacy and regulatory
        concerns. NMDP bridges this gap by offering a{' '}
        <strong>trusted national platform</strong> where Norwegian research
        groups, hospitals, and laboratories can safely manage and share their
        data according to international{' '}
        <strong>FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)</strong>{' '}
        principles.
